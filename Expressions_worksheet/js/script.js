//Example
//Calculate the Circumference of a Circle
var radius = 6;
const PI = 3.14159265;

//multiply 2, PI and the radius & assign to circ variable.
var circ = radius * 2 * PI;
//print out the output circumference
console.log("The circumference of the circle is " + circ );

//Dog Years
//Calculate how old Sparky the pit bull is in dog years based on his actual age
var human = 5 //human years variable

//multiply 7 to human variable
var dog = human * 7

//print out the output dog years
console.log("Sparky is " + human + " human years old which is " + dog + " in dog years.");

//Slice of Pie part 1
//Calculate how much pizza each partygoer will get at the party
var pizza = 20  //pizzas ordered variable
var people = 50   //partygoer variable
var slice = 8    //pizza slices variable

//multiply the number of pizzas by number of slices of each pizza, then divide by the number of people
var ate = (20*8)/50  //slices every person ate variable

//print out the output slices for each person
console.log("Each person ate " + ate + " slices of pizza at the party.")

//---------------//

//Slice of Pie part 2
//Calculate how much pizza each partygoer will get at the party
var pizza = 20  //pizzas ordered variable
var people = 50   //partygoer variable
var slice = 8    //pizza slices variable

//multiply the number of pizzas by number of slices of each pizza, then calculate the remainder(%) slices from the number of person
var remainder = (20*8) % 50  //slices remainder for Sparky variable 

//print out the output slices Sparky got
console.log("Sparky got " + remainder + " slices of pizza.")
